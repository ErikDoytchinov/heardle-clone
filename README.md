1. Plan the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
   -- Features for the MVP:
   -- Input a Spotify playlist URL.
   -- Randomly pick a song from the playlist.
   -- Play a 1-second audio snippet (progressively increase snippet length for wrong guesses).
   -- Display a list of recommended songs to choose from.
   -- Allow the user to input their guess and check if it’s correct.
   -- Focus on Core Functionality: Don’t worry about styling or extra features yet—just make it work!

2. Build the Frontend (React App)
    1. Create React App:
       -- Inside the frontend/ folder:

npx create-react-app frontend
cd frontend
npm start

    2.	Integrate the Backend:
    --	Install axios:

npm install axios

    --	Fetch playlist details from the backend and display them in your React app.

    3.	Create Game Logic:
    --	Set up states for:
    --	Current snippet duration (e.g., 1s, 2s, etc.).
    --	User’s current guess.
    --	Game progress and score.
    4.	Implement Audio Playback:
    --	Use the Web Audio API to play audio snippets.

5. Build Core Game Logic

    1. Random Song Picker:
       -- Create a function to select a random song from the fetched playlist.
    2. Audio Playback Logic:
       -- Fetch the song preview URL from Spotify and play it for the required snippet duration.
    3. Guess Checking:
       -- Compare the user’s input to the correct song title and update the game state accordingly.
    4. Progressive Stages:
       -- Double the snippet duration on each incorrect guess.

6. Deploy Your App
    1. Frontend:
       -- Use Netlify or Vercel for easy deployment:

npm run build

    2.	Backend:
    --	Deploy to Heroku or Render.
    3.	Environment Variables:
    --	Secure your Client ID and Client Secret using environment variable settings in your deployment platform.

7. Test and Iterate
   -- Test Locally: Test all game features and ensure the flow is smooth.
   -- Fix Bugs: Debug and refine your app.
   -- Add Features: Once the core game works, start adding styling, leaderboards, or advanced features.
